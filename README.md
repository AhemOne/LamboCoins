### FAQ
- **Why Lamborghini?**

The first car any cryptomillionaire must buy is obviously a Lamborghini, so logically the original ultra rare coin should be based on them. This coin will also provide investors with bonuses when our games are released to thank you for helping our cause.

- **Why only 256 coins?**

For Exclusivity, Like a real Lamborghini each coin is exclusive and made in limited numbers. This IGO is the only IGO that will occur meaning you will be one of the elite few who can have the privelege of owning one (or many, depending on how much Ether you have). 256 was chosen because it is equal to 2^8, it's an awesome number.

- **How do I get them?**

Add the ICO contract above to your ethereum client to purchase. Single coins may be purchased by sending the current price in ether directly to the contract, multiple coin purchases require the ICO interface or use our ~~Website~~ (coming soon!).

- **Will I get my left over Ether back?**

You may withdraw funds up until the ICO contract is finished. After this time any remaining funds can no longer be refunded as the contract will be withdrawn from the blockchain.

- **Why wont it let me send Ether to the ICO?**

You can only purchase a single coin at a time by sending Ether directly, and will only accept a payment of a single Lamborghini at the current price, up to `current price * 110%`. To purchase more at once, please add the interface described above to your wallet interface or use our ~~website~~ (coming soon!).
